      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>

      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>

      <li> Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
</p>
<div class="graycode">
<pre><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code></pre>
</div>
<hr>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>

      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>

      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: </p>
      
      <ul><li>The name of the function.</li>
      <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. </li>
      <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: </p>

      <pre><code class="graycode">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code></pre>

      <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function. </p>

      <code class="graycode">return number * number;</code>

      <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function. </p>
